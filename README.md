# Peer to Peer Encrypted Voice Messaging (via Bluetooth)
A common evolution of the instant messaging is to send short burst of voice between parties. This
application will send voice messages between persons with similar confirmation like WhatsApp. To
accomplish this, the receiver will send an acknowledge message when received and another message
when the package is listened to by the user.
